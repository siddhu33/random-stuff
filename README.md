Helper Functions and other useful tools that I have made.
**num2latex.m** - MATLAB script that takes in an array and returns the LaTeX representation of it as a string. Requires \usepackage{amsmath} to work.
**EdgeDetection.cs** - A C# console program that applies basic image filtering to a .bmp file (will never replace photoshop, but it's cool!)
**Radix 2 DIT FFT** - C++ program that calculates the FFT of a particular input.
